# Coin Toss Simulator

This is a simple Python program that simulates tossing a coin 10 times. Each toss randomly results in either "Heads" or "Tails," and the results are printed to the console. Itâ€™s a basic demonstration of randomness and loops in Python.

## Features

- Simulates 10 coin tosses
- Uses `random.randint()` to generate outcomes
- Outputs the result of each toss with its toss number
- Uses constants for cleaner and more readable code

## How to Run

1. Make sure Python is installed on your computer.
2. Save the file as `coin_toss_simulator.py`
3. Open your terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the folder where the file is saved.
5. Run the program

## What I Learned

- How to use `random.randint()` to simulate chance-based events
- Using constants to improve code readability and maintainability
- Controlling program flow with loops
- Printing formatted output using `f-strings`
